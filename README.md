A food delivery platform that supports three types of users: customers, delivery drivers, and restaurant owners.

<Strong>Customers</Strong> can browse a variety of restaurants, place orders, and track their delivery in real-time via an interactive map.

<Strong>Delivery drivers</Strong> can view available delivery requests, select orders to fulfill, and follow a mapped itinerary from their current location to the customer's address.

<Strong>Restaurant owners</Strong> can manage their digital menu and access key performance statistics through a dedicated dashboard.

For security and quality assurance, new restaurants must be added by an administrator. Restaurant owners must contact an admin to have their restaurant listed.
