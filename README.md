Food delivery app that allows customers, delivery  drivers and restaurant owners to register. Customers can browse through multiple restaurants, place orders, 
and follow their driver's location through a map. Delivery drivers can pick from many orders to deliver and see the itinerary from their position to the customer's address. 
Restaurant owners can use the website to edit their online menu and see their restaurant's statistics. For safety reasons, restaurant owners have to contact an administrator,
who will be the one to add restaurants to the site.
